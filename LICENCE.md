The data in this repository currently exist in a licensing twilight. We ([Myself](https://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/casa/people/mphil-phd-students/Stephan_Hugel), [Dr Eleanor Robson](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history/people/academic-staff/eleanor-robson/eleanor-robson) (UCL), [Dr Jon Taylor](http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/departments/staff/middle_east/jonathan_taylor.aspx) (British Museum), and [Prof Steve Tinney](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/nelc/people/facultyProfiles.html) (Penn)) think they may be in the public domain, and they are available to anyone in the form of a [database dump](db_dumps). However, in the absence of a licence, I am not sure what you may do with them in terms of reuse and/or publishing. Until this is clarified, it would be best to ask if in doubt.
